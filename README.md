# Vigenere_Cipher_CSharp

This is an implementation of the vigenere cipher in C# using Windows Forms. When you read about the original vigenere cipher 
you will find out it is using a letter matrix to ciphre, for me the ascii works as well. 
The Vigenere Cipher is an expansion of the Casesar cipher and using a passphrase instead of a simple number to encrypt.
